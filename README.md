## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hello! I am a student deeply passionate about AI and deep learning. Through various projects and research, I am continually expanding my knowledge, with a particular focus on the following areas:

Time Series Forecasting: I am keen on analyzing patterns and trends in data to make accurate predictions about the future. My goal is to develop more precise and efficient forecasting models.

Image Processing: My work in computer vision revolves around analyzing images and developing various applications based on this analysis.

Model Compression: I am exploring methods to compress deep learning models for efficient deployment, aiming to reduce model size and computational costs without compromising performance.

SoC Estimation Project: I worked on a project that leveraged deep learning models to estimate the performance and state of System on Chips (SoCs). This project aimed to develop a solution capable of accurately and in real-time predicting the state of SoCs using advanced deep learning techniques.

With the knowledge and experience gained from these endeavors, I aim to contribute to the transformative impact of AI technology across various industries. I am excited to continue learning and tackling new challenges in the field.
